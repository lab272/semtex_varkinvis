The general introduction for semtex and its compilation is contained
in semtex/README.md, a human-readable MarkDown file.  If you wish to
peruse a pretty version of that file, use a MarkDown previewer to open
it. README.md is also part of the semtex doxygen documentation chain,
see doc/Makefile.

The source for the user guide PDF is in the semtex/doc directory - run
"make" in semtex/doc to generate it.  Doxygen can generate a
cross-linked set of files for the code which may be easier to peruse
than is possible via a text editor - run "make doxygen" in the
semtex/doc directory and then open semtex/doc/html/index.html in a
browser.

Please note that there are presently (2021) two compilation systems
for semtex: (a) one that works with cmake - ultimately this ends up
running make with Makfiles it generates based on CmakeLists.txt
documents - and (b) one that works directly with make and pre-existing
Makefiles.  We suggest that you use method (a) and treat (b) as
deprecated; it exists to allow fine-scale control over the compilation
system and flags, and for systems that do not have cmake.
